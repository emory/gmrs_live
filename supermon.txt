look for this is the list.php file

// Added WA3DSP Weather conditions
if (isset($LOCALZIP)) {
    $WX = exec("/usr/local/sbin/weather.sh $LOCALZIP v");
    print "<p style=\"margin-top:0px;\">[ Weather conditions for $LOCATION $LOCALZIP: ";
    print "<span style=\"margin-top:0px; background-color: GAINSBORO;\">&nbsp;$WX&nbsp;</span> ]";
}

and replace all that with this code


include ("/etc/asterisk/local/mm-software/supermon_weather.php");



This will be added to the installer in later versions.
